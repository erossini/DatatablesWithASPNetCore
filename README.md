# Datatables.net with ASP.NET Core (.NET 5)
This is the code related to my post on [PureSourceCode](https://www.puresourcecode.com/dotnet/net-core/datatables-in-asp-net-core-server-side/).

We will learn how to use Datatables in ASP.NET Core with Server-Side Processing. We will also be building a simple real-world implementation to help understand Datatables.net to it’s fullest. You can find the source code of the entire implementation here. Let’s begin. By the way, this is my first test to integrate new functionalities in my [AdminLTE project](https://www.puresourcecode.com/dotnet/net-core/features-for-adminlte-with-asp-net-core/).
